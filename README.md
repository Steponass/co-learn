# Tech Stack

- **Supabase**: Chosen for its all-in-one approach: PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security for data protection, built-in authentication eliminating custom auth logic, and real-time subscriptions for instant updates to bookings, chat messages, and presence status.
- **LiveKit**: Selected for production-grade video conferencing with excellent React support. Its component library provided a solid foundation while allowing customization of the UI.
- **NotificationAPI**: Integrated to handle transactional emails (session invitations, booking confirmations) without managing email infrastructure. Service provides reliable delivery and tracking while keeping the codebase focused on core features. Thanks, NotificationAPI team!
- **Next.js + React** â€“ Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes, ideal for authentication and secure token generation for LiveKit connections. React's component model allowed for clean separation between business logic and UI, making the codebase (somewhat?) maintainable as features grew.
